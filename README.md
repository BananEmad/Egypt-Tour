##### Description:
###### Pack your bags. We’re going on vacation!
###### That’s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. It should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy.
###### By breaking the country into smaller, more manageable areas, the site aims to create a virtual travel experience that allows the user to explore the sights of Egypt right from their computer.
###### This can help visitors decide where they want to go within this massive country. If they’re looking for a relaxed beach trip, for example, they’ll have very different options from travelers looking for hiking trips or adventure tours.
